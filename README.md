# InQue 👨🏻‍🎓
#### A Web Scraping Service For Interview Questions

### Requirements
- NodeJS 
- MongoDB

### How to run?
```
$ cd InQue
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

### What’s left?
- For now, the file is stored on the local file system. We are working on storing the output file in a cloud platform and making it available for everyone, so that they can download the same.
- Cleaning the output, ie, formatting. Currently, the output is a text file which is not very pretty to look at, nor is it convenient.
- Currently requires both a company name and website URL, we are working on using multiple websites for scraping the questions when just a company name is given by the user.
- UI/UX - Making the web application look better
